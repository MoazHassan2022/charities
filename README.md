# charities
It is a website like a guidebook for charities all over Saudi Arabia with all its details, locations, contacts and searching for it with different ways.

I developed it with DJANGO in python language and created its database with sqlite then converted it to postgresql for deploying.

It was for freelancing for a client.

I also contributed in its frontend with html, css and javascript.

I deployed this website on heroku.
